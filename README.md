Prior to running the hotel web application, the backend serve must be up and running - Recommend using Intellij IDE to start the server - If you would like to see the data in the DB in real-time changes,
open MySQL Workbench and connect to App's Schema after starting backend server - After completing first two steps, enter following command on the terminal of VSCode IDE:
npm run dev

Troubleshooting tips: - If "npm run dev" fails, you might have to cd into the ./babydrivers-react/src folder
